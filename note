Attention! For all the data, you need to free up at least 20GB of disk space.

this is part of the data. you may need to make some slight changes.
you need to free up at least 17GB of disk space to execute the program 'pipline.py', and it will take a lot of time.
1. python pipline.py
2. python SimAST-GCN.py

for astnn, we recommend you to remove the files generated by the pipline.py. Then, do the following operation.
1. python ast_pipline.py
2. python astnn.py


for dace, we all recommend you to remove the files generated by other files. Then, do the following operation.
1. python token_pre.py
2. python dace.py


Attention, now no need for large disk space!!!
